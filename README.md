This repository is part of an internship task where I have conducted research on Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) and created a sample VAPT test along with a comprehensive report. The testing was performed on the vulnerable web application available at http://testphp.vulnweb.com.

Key files in the repo:
BURP SUITE: A step-by-step approach to testing the application using Burp Suite.
ZAP: A step-by-step approach to testing the application using Burp Suite.
RESEARCH ON VAPT: This file contains all the information and resources I studied during the research phase before initiating the VAPT testing.
REPORT: The final VAPT report outlining all vulnerabilities found, their potential risks, and recommended mitigations.

This repo reflects both the process and outcomes of my research and practical application of VAPT methodologies.
